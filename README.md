My_Debtors: Team 40


A (web based application) website that helps schools in a locality view and keep track of studentâ€™s credit history. The platform helps the schools know if new students have outstanding bills in their previous school. 


Goal of The Project: 
The goal of the project is to provide a user friendly platform that would enable schools within a particular locality share the list of student owning them and prevent them from getting admitted to other schools within that locality without clearing their outstanding debt in previous schools.
