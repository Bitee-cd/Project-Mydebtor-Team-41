                    <p>You have certain rights around the use of your data, including the ability to opt out of promotional emails, cookies, and collection of your data by certain third parties. You can update or terminate your account from within our Services, and can also contact us for individual rights requests about your personal data.

                    <p class="indent"> The Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) 2019 gives you certain rights in respect of the Personal Data we hold about you. Below is a highlight of some of those rights. It is not a complete, exhaustive statement of your rights in respect of your Personal Data:</p>
                   
                       <ol>
                        <li>
                            You have a right to consent to this Policy and to withdraw your consent at any time. However, your withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</li>
                        <li>You have a right to a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you, as well as the information about what we do with it, who we share it with and how long we hold it for, provided you show us/forward the proof of your identity. We may make a reasonable charge for additional copies of that data in the case of unfounded and excessive requests.</li>
                        <li>You have a right to freely transfer your data received from us to any other person.</li>
                        <li>You have the right to have the Personal Data we hold about you corrected, if it is factually inaccurate, by notifying us of such amendment/update. You may contact us for this purpose.</li>
                        <li>In some circumstances, you have the right to the deletion of the information that we hold about you.</li>

                    <h3>Security</h3>
                    <p>Studebt takes security of data very seriously. Studebt works hard to protect Information you provide from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure. These steps take into account the sensitivity of the Information we collect, process and store, and the current state of technology. Studebt has received internationally recognized security certifications. Although we use appropriate security measures once we have received your Personal Data, the transmission of data over the internet (including by email) is never completely secure. We endeavour to protect Personal Data, but we cannot guarantee the absolute security of Personal Data transmitted to us or by us. We will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
