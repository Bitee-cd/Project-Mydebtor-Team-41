AUTHENTICATION
Using Django and DjangoRestFrameWork API package, i created a core app for our project, and designed the a CustomUser class from Django's AbstractUser. 
The core app is meant to handle all authentication modules.
I installed Djoser package into the application's installed apps in settings.py file of the Project directory, and configured its settings to meet the authentication 
requirements of our web Application. 
With the Djoser package, i configured the, Register, Login, Logout, RestPassword, Activate account and Google Authentication.

MYDEBTORS 
I created a 'mydebtors' app for our project, the app contains serializers.py to handle all the serializations of data,
and signals.py to send emails to guardians of debtors once their child/ward have been added as a debtor on our platform.
I designed the models.py to be able to meet the requirements of the application.  
created permission, validators , pagination modules to help secure our API

INFO_HUB
I assisted my team mates in desgning the views, models, and serializers.py files of the app that acts as the information hub of our project, where school admins can make
post and comments.
